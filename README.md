# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

To help decision makers in PyBer, we organized the fares data to be diaplayed by city type, and fares per week. We did this by creating a pivot table, as well as a chart to show a summary of, and display the results of the fares for PyBer rides. 

## Results

The analysis of the PyBer ride-sharing shows:

* Average fare per ride:

    * The average Rural fare is 41% more expensive that the Urban fares and 11% more expensive that the Suburban fares.
    * The average Suburban fare is 26% more expensive that the average Urban fare.
    
* Average fare per driver:
    
    * The average Rural driver makes 3.3 times than an Urban driver, and 1.4 times than a Suburban driver.
    * The average Suburban driver makes 2.3 times more than an Urban driver.
    
* Total fares:

    * Urban cities make 9.2 times more than Rural cities, and 2 times more than Suburban cities.
    * Suburban cities make 4.4 times more than Rural cities.

* Total drivers vs rides:
 
    * Rural cities have on average 1.6 drivers for each ride.
    * Suburban cities have on average 1.2 drivers for each ride.
    * Urban cities have on average .67 drivers for each ride.
